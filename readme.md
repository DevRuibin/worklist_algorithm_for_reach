# Worklist algorithm

This is a simple implementation of the worklist algorithm for dataflow analysis. 
It is based on the course LINFO2251 at UCLouvain.

I have implemented the algorithm in Python while the node class is a bit complex with too many trivial methods.
But those methods are easy to understand as they are just setters and getters. I hope this 
will help you to understand the algorithm and the dataflow analysis.

If you are interested in it and want to let the algorithm become more elegant, you are welcome to contribute to this demo.
